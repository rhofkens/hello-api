# Java Coding Conventions and Best Practices

## 1. Code Structure and Organization

### 1.1 Package Naming
- Use lowercase letters and numbers, separated by dots.
- Start with your organization's reversed domain name (e.g., com.company.project).

### 1.2 Class Naming
- Use PascalCase for class names.
- Choose descriptive and meaningful names.
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely recognized.

### 1.3 Method Naming
- Use camelCase for method names.
- Start with a verb describing the action (e.g., getUserById, calculateTotal).

### 1.4 Variable Naming
- Use camelCase for variable names.
- Choose clear and descriptive names.
- Avoid single-letter variables except for loop counters.

### 1.5 Constant Naming
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
- Declare constants as static final.

### 1.6 File Organization
- One top-level class per file.
- Organize imports alphabetically and remove unused imports.
- Group related classes in packages.

## 2. Code Formatting

### 2.1 Indentation
- Use 4 spaces for indentation, not tabs.
- Align multiline statements consistently.

### 2.2 Line Length
- Limit lines to 120 characters maximum.
- Break long lines at logical points.

### 2.3 Braces
- Use Egyptian brackets (opening brace on the same line).
- Always use braces, even for single-line blocks.

### 2.4 Whitespace
- Use blank lines to separate logical blocks of code.
- Use a single space around operators and after commas.

## 3. Code Quality and Maintainability

### 3.1 SOLID Principles
- Follow SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion).

### 3.2 Design Patterns
- Use appropriate design patterns to solve common problems.
- Document the use of design patterns in comments.

### 3.3 Code Duplication
- Avoid code duplication. Extract common code into reusable methods or classes.

### 3.4 Method Length
- Keep methods short and focused (preferably under 30 lines).
- Extract long methods into smaller, more focused methods.

### 3.5 Class Size
- Keep classes focused and not too large (preferably under 500 lines).
- Split large classes into smaller, more focused classes.

### 3.6 Commenting
- Write clear, concise comments for complex logic.
- Use Javadoc for public APIs and important methods.
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes.

### 3.7 Exception Handling
- Use specific exceptions instead of generic ones.
- Always include meaningful error messages.
- Log exceptions with appropriate context.

## 4. Performance and Scalability

### 4.1 Resource Management
- Always close resources (use try-with-resources when possible).
- Use connection pooling for database connections.

### 4.2 Concurrency
- Use thread-safe collections and classes when dealing with concurrency.
- Avoid shared mutable state.
- Use java.util.concurrent utilities for complex concurrency scenarios.

### 4.3 Memory Management
- Avoid creating unnecessary objects.
- Use StringBuilder for string concatenation in loops.
- Be cautious with large collections and implement pagination where appropriate.

### 4.4 Caching
- Implement caching for frequently accessed, rarely changing data.
- Use distributed caching for multi-node deployments.

### 4.5 Database Optimization
- Write efficient SQL queries.
- Use database indexes appropriately.
- Implement database-level pagination for large result sets.

## 5. Logging and Tracing

### 5.1 Logging Framework
- Use a robust logging framework like SLF4J with Logback.

### 5.2 Log Levels
- Use appropriate log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE).
- Configure different log levels for different environments.

### 5.3 Log Content
- Include relevant context in log messages (e.g., request IDs, user IDs).
- Avoid logging sensitive information (e.g., passwords, personal data).

### 5.4 Performance Logging
- Log performance metrics for critical operations.
- Use MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) for request tracing.

### 5.5 Error Logging
- Log full stack traces for exceptions.
- Include relevant application state in error logs.

## 6. Testing

### 6.1 Unit Testing
- Aim for high unit test coverage (at least 80%).
- Use JUnit 5 for unit testing.
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert).

### 6.2 Integration Testing
- Write integration tests for critical system interactions.
- Use appropriate frameworks (e.g., Spring Test) for integration testing.

### 6.3 Mocking
- Use Mockito for mocking dependencies in unit tests.

### 6.4 Test Naming
- Use descriptive test method names (e.g., "shouldReturnUserWhenValidIdProvided").

### 6.5 Test Data
- Use meaningful test data.
- Avoid hardcoding test data; use test data builders or factories.

### 6.6 Continuous Integration
- Run all tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- Fail the build if tests fail or coverage drops below the threshold.

## 7. Security

### 7.1 Input Validation
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

### 7.2 Authentication and Authorization
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Use secure session management.

### 7.3 Sensitive Data
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Use secure hashing algorithms for passwords (e.g., bcrypt).

### 7.4 Dependency Management
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
- Use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check in your build process.

## 8. Documentation

### 8.1 README
- Maintain an up-to-date README with project setup instructions.

### 8.2 API Documentation
- Document all public APIs using Javadoc.
- Include example usage where appropriate.

### 8.3 Architecture Documentation
- Maintain high-level architecture documentation.
- Use diagrams to illustrate system components and interactions.

## 9. Version Control

### 9.1 Branching Strategy
- Follow Git Flow or a similar branching strategy.
- Use feature branches for all changes.

### 9.2 Commit Messages
- Write clear, concise commit messages.
- Follow a consistent commit message format.

### 9.3 Code Reviews
- Require code reviews for all changes.
- Use pull requests for code reviews.

## 10. Build and Deployment

### 10.1 Build Tool
- Use Maven or Gradle for build management.

### 10.2 Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated building, testing, and deployment.

### 10.3 Environment Configuration
- Externalize configuration for different environments.
- Use environment variables or configuration servers for sensitive configuration.

### 10.4 Containerization
- Use Docker for containerizing applications.
- Follow best practices for creating efficient Docker images.

Remember, these conventions should be tailored to your specific project needs and team preferences. Regularly review and update these conventions as your project evolves.
